# DCN-PROJECT

Description:
This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a comprehensive organizational network using Cisco Packet Tracer. It incorporates key networking principles, including VLAN segmentation, DHCP configuration, secure remote management via SSH, and efficient routing using OSPF. The network topology includes star, mesh, and hybrid designs to ensure scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance.

Key Features:

VLAN segmentation for departments (Admin, Sales, Finance, HR, Reception,IT and Logistics and so on).
Dynamic IP assignment via DHCP on routers.
Secure router management using SSH.
Packet analysis with Wireshark for traffic and performance evaluation.
A hybrid topology combining star and mesh networks for optimal performance.
Deliverables:

Detailed report covering topologies, configurations, and protocols.
Network architecture screenshots and configuration files.
Presentation slides and project demo video.
This project showcases a real-world application of networking principles, providing a scalable and secure network architecture for a medium-sized organization.
